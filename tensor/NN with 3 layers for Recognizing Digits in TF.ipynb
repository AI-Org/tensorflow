    "Now we’ll create a simple three layer neural network in TensorFlow.  In future articles, we’ll show how to build more complicated neural network structures such as convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks.  For this example though, we’ll keep it simple.  If you need to scrub up on your neural network basics, check out my popular tutorial on the subject.  In this example, we’ll be using the MNIST dataset (and its associated loader) that the TensorFlow package provides.  This MNIST dataset is a set of 28×28 pixel grayscale images which represent hand-written digits.  It has 55,000 training rows, 10,000 testing rows and 5,000 validation rows.\n",

Remember that y and y_clipped in the above calculation are (m x 10) tensors – therefore we need to perform the first sum over the second axis.

Therefore, the correct_prediction operation returns a tensor of size (m x 1) of True and False values designating whether the neural network has correctly predicted the digit.
